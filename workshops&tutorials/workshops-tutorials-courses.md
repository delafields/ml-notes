# Workshops, Tutorials, and Courses

## Workshops

* Andreas Meuller's (Scikit-Learn core dev) 4 part **Scikit-Learn workshop**. At the time of finding this I'm already familiar with the library, so skipping some parts. My work can be found in the [scikit-workshops](scikit-workshops/scikit-workshop.md) folder. Links to the original course material can be found there as well.

# Courses
* [Harvard CS109: Data Science](https://github.com/cs109/content)'s labs & homework assignments. Work is in the [CS109-DataScience](CS109.md) folder.
