    "**Bootstrap resampling** is a general purpose way to use empirical data like the `errors` DataFrame to estimate uncertainties. For example, consider the [Viriginia Governor Race](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2013/governor/va/virginia_governor_cuccinelli_vs_mcauliffe-3033.html). If we wanted to estimate how likey it is that McAuliffe will win given the current RCP data, the approch would be:\n",

    "1. Pick a large number N of experiments to run (say N=1000).\n",
    "2. For each experiment, randomly select a value from `errors.error`. We are assuming that these numbers represent a reasonable error distribution for the current poll data.\n",
    "3. Assume that the error on McAullife's current polling score is given by this number (and, by extension, the error on Cuccinelli's poll score is the opposite). Calculate who actually wins the election in this simulation.\n",

    "Bootstrapping isn't foolproof: it makes the assumption that the previous Governor race errors are representative of the Virginia race, and it does a bad job at estimating very rare events (with only ~30 races in the errors DataFrame, it would be hard to accurately predict probabilities for 1-in-a-million scenarios). Nevertheless, it's a versatile technique.\n",
