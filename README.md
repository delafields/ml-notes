# ML Notes

Notes and toy implementations of machine learning techniques

[basic-models](basic-models/basic-models.md) ⬅️ Mostly classical, simpler techniques and models i.e. Regressions, SVMs,Cross Entropy etc. Most with code, some pure notes.

[deep-learning](deep-learning/deep-learning.md) ⬅️ This houses some deep learning code - bite-sized projects and commonly used architectures
