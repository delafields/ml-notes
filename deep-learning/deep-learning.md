# Deep Learning
---

This houses some deep learning code, most copied from tutorials/others' repos. Used as a learning exercise & refresher.

##### Applied NNs
These are bite-sized, often not fleshed out applications of deep learning. Beginner CNN's, text classification, autoencoders, etc.

##### Architectures
These are more full-fleged than the above. Some are commonly used architectures, some are more in depth applications of neural nets.
